# 📧 Email Spam Classifier
This project is a Machine Learning-based Email Spam Classifier that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones. Using a combination of feature extraction and classification algorithms, this model identifies spam emails with high accuracy, providing a robust solution for email filtering.

🔍 How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Email text is cleaned and converted into features using TF-IDF.
Model Training: A classification model is trained using labeled email data (spam/ham).
Prediction: The model predicts whether new emails are spam or legitimate.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using various performance metrics to ensure reliability.
